About halfway through the interview process for a job at an e-commerce platform, in the course of researching the company I realized they were hosting an online store for a website I consider reprehensible. Here's the letter I wrote to them.

*Hello [recruiter/employees of platform currently hosting a thing I consider evil],*

*Please accept my sincere apologies for the late notice, but I need to cancel the interview we have scheduled for today.*

*I read a lot about WWII, and spend a lot of time thinking about one thing in particular: what could ordinary Germans have done to prevent the Holocaust without wielding state oppression?
Nonviolent, extra-governmental pushback against the underlying toxic ideas is the only ethical response I can come up with.*

*This can happen at several different levels:*

- *a lawmaker could refuse to vote for a law that requires businesses display a "No Jews" sign in their window*
- *a police officer could refuse to enforce such a law*
- *a company could refuse to obey such a law*
- *an employee could refuse to work at a store that displays such a sign*
- *a customer could refuse to shop at a store that displays such a sign*

*The opportunity to resist trickles down, becoming less effective at each level.
But enough action at any level can stem or reverse the momentum of the idea at play.*

*Unlike people, some ideas deserve to die before they are realized. In some ways, government oppression--to which I am radically opposed--can give an idea more power. On the other hand, private speech contradicting the idea provides a distributed pressure that lacks a single point of failure.*

*I'm in a position right now to weaken the tide of ideas-I-think-deserve-to-die flowing out of [unethical customer on your platform] by not continuing this interview process. I'm grateful to you for providing me an opportunity to act in a way that embodies my ideals.*

*I really enjoyed speaking with all of you, and I sincerely thank you for your time. I'm disappointed to cut things short and would be happy to stay in touch. I hope you will consider revoking the credibility you are currently lending to [unethical merchant on your platform]; if that ever happens, I'd be thrilled to hear from you!*

*Sincerely,*

*AJ*
